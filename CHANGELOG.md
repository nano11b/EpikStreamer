# Changelog

## 2.1.1 — 2026-10-25
### Fixed
- "Sign in to EpikChat & get stream key" no longer gets stuck at "Continue". The automation now follows EpikChat's real Go-live dialog:
  - picks the open modal by `aria-modal`/`aria-label` and visibility (ignoring the hidden emoji-picker dialog);
  - selects **RTMP encoder** in the *Stream source* group and waits for `aria-pressed="true"`;
  - clicks **Continue**, then follows the same dialog as it becomes *Choose your audience* (there is no second Continue);
  - picks Public/Private, clicks **Create live stream** (once), then reads the server and key from the *Connect your encoder* dialog after **Show stream key**.
- Clicks use a full pointer/mouse event sequence. Each step polls until its result is visible.
- Every step's status, including the dialog currently seen, is shown in the window and written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EpikStreamer\signin.log`.
- Reading the key is more robust: inputs, `code`/`pre`/`kbd`, copy-button data attributes, labelled text, and full `rtmp://…/x/KEY` URLs.
### Added
- Mock EpikChat page mirroring the real DOM (`EpikStreamer.Tests/mock`) with a headless-Chrome check (`run-mock.sh`).

## 2.1.0 — 2026-10-25
### Added
- Crossfade transitions between playlist items (`xfade` + `acrossfade`), 0–5 s, 16 styles. Seamless across loop, shuffle, skip and reconnect.
- Chat side panel: EpikChat `/chat` in WebView2, sharing the sign-in session (never a second chat session), compact CSS mode. Viewer count and live status shown on the Stats tab and in the title bar (selectors untested against the live site).
- Multiple outputs per profile (EpikChat / Twitch / YouTube / Kick / Custom presets) via one encode + `tee` (`onfail=ignore`), with per-destination status.
- Local recording to MKV with optional lossless remux to MP4, plus folder and filename-pattern settings.
- Per-user Inno Setup installer (bundled ffmpeg, shortcuts, uninstaller, WebView2 check).
- Auto-update from GitHub Releases (`nano11b/EpikStreamer`): checks on startup and on demand, asks before downloading, verifies SHA-256, runs the installer silently. Optional GitHub token, for rate limits only.
- `installer/build-installer.ps1`, `installer/release.ps1` (optional env-var Authenticode signing, `update.json` + `.sha256`, `gh release create`), `.gitignore`.
### Changed
- New streaming engine: segments are pre-rendered with exact timestamps, and the encoder paces with `-re`. There are no gaps or timestamp jumps between items (verified with ffprobe).
- Stream keys are DPAPI-encrypted per output and masked in all logs (including tee-escaped forms).
- v2.0 profiles are migrated automatically (single server/key → one EpikChat output).

## 2.0.0
- Playlists, overlays (logo/text/clock), hardware encoders with auto-detect, auto-reconnect, stats/preview, profiles, EpikChat sign-in & stream-key helper.

## 1.0.0
- First release: stream a single file to an RTMP server with ffmpeg.
